----
= Introduction =
This plugin integrates websites that host videos or stream live tv into <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/">!MediaPortal</a>.
Examples are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">!YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.wwitv.com/">wwitv</a>.

The videos/streams can be discovered by reading RSS feeds, parsing HTML, programming against provided APIs or directly adding urls of live streams. Only direct links to video files or streams (.flv, .mp4, ...) are supported, because they will be rendered using <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectShow">directshow</a>. This allows usage of your favorite codecs to control audio and video quality (e.g. using ffdshow you can upscale low quality videos as well as upmix stereo sound and output to spdif) and gives the best integration with !MediaPortal.

= User Interface =
The main view of the plugin at first shows a list of languages represented by flags that is build from all sites in your personal list. This automatic grouping of sites can be disabled or customized. Selecting a group will show all sites for it. By selecting a site you can dive into the categories for that site. If a category has subcategories (e.g. Miro), by selecting a category you will dive into the subcategories recursivly, otherwise a list of videos for that category is shown. Each of these 4 views  can be shown as a list, small thumbs or large thumbs. Some sites support a details view that provides more information and a list of clips for a movie.

 * Create a new group (<img width="16" src="http://mp-onlinevideos2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/OnlineVideos.MediaPortal1/Resources/NewFolder.png"/>) in the lower part and fill the name and optional url of a logo
 * Select that group and add a new stream(<img width="16" src="http://mp-onlinevideos2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/OnlineVideos.MediaPortal1/Resources/tv.png"/>)
 * Fill the streamname, streamUrl (remember: this must be the direct url of the stream, and not some url to a page with a flashplayer playing that stream), and optionally the url of the logo.
 * Save, Start Mediaportal and enjoy.
==Codecs== 
On the Codec tab, you can test your system for playback of different video types. If playback succeeds here, it will tell you what filter is used to split the file into audio and video and you should have no problems playing files of that type in MediaPortal.
